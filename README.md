# amazon-Linux-wkhtmltopdf-layer

This is a layer of wkhtmltopdf binary on amazon linux, anyone can use this layer for there own code , for my usecase i used this layer for my nodejs lambda function.

wkhtmltopdf are open source (LGPLv3) command line tools to render HTML into PDF and various image formats using the Qt WebKit rendering engine. These run entirely "headless" and do not require a display or display service.
